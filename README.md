### DATE: 04/09/2025                                                                           
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223230199
## Aim:

To design an **AI-powered chatbot** that assists customers in resolving issues related to **product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries**. The chatbot should handle customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone.

In this experiment (Case Study 2), we will employ **different prompting techniques** — Comparative Analysis Prompt, Universal Prompt, Structured Prompt Refinements, and Prompt Size Limitations — to design a report for a selected **Unit 5 use case**, using **Unit 2 prompt types**.

## Procedure:

### 1. Idea Generation Prompts

* **Prompt:**

  > “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?”

* **Generated Ideas:**

  * Sensors for **real-time monitoring** of equipment performance.
  * **Predictive maintenance alerts** to anticipate equipment failures.
  * **Energy usage optimization** via automated switching based on demand.
  * **Cloud-based dashboards** for remote monitoring and control.

---

### 2. Persona and Context Prompts

* **Prompt:**

  > “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?”

* **Generated Context:**

  * UI should be **intuitive**, displaying machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
  * System should convey **reliability** and **ease of use**, requiring minimal training.

---

### 3. Comparative Analysis Prompt

* **Prompt:**

  > “Compare traditional manual monitoring with the IoT-enabled automated system in terms of efficiency, downtime, and energy usage.”

* **Generated Analysis:**

  * **Traditional Monitoring:** Labor-intensive, prone to errors, frequent downtime, delayed response.
  * **IoT Automation:** **30% efficiency increase**, predictive maintenance reduces downtime, optimized energy management, improved accuracy and scalability.

---

### 4. Universal Prompt

* **Prompt:**

  > “Generate a universal system description for an IoT-enabled manufacturing automation platform suitable for all industries.”

* **Generated Output:**

  * A **scalable, cloud-integrated IoT automation platform** with real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, energy optimization, and user-friendly dashboards adaptable across multiple industries.

---

### 5. Structured Prompt Refinements

* **Prompt:**

  > “Refine the system description into structured sections: Objectives, Features, Benefits.”

* **Generated Output:**

  * **Objectives:** Increase efficiency, minimize downtime, optimize energy.
  * **Features:** IoT sensors, predictive alerts, dashboards, automation controllers.
  * **Benefits:** 30% productivity boost, cost reduction, sustainable energy use, higher reliability.

---

### 6. Prompt Size Limitations

* **Prompt:**

  > “Summarize the entire automation system in less than 40 words.”

* **Generated Summary:**

  * “A cloud-based IoT automation platform enabling real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and energy optimization to improve efficiency, reduce downtime, and enhance productivity across industries.”
